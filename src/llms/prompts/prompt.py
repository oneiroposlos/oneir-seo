	Act as an expert emotion classifier. Analyze the user's input below and follow these steps:
    1. **Mood Identification**: Classify the user's primary mood from this list:
       [Happy, Sad, Anxious, Angry, Calm, Excited, Stressed, Lonely, Neutral].
       If none fit, choose the closest option or add a new mood (e.g., "Bored").
    2. **Confidence Score**: Rate your confidence in the classification (1-10, 10=highest).
    3. **Reasoning**: Explain key phrases, tone, or context that led to your conclusion.
       Highlight metaphors, emojis, or linguistic cues (e.g., sarcasm).
    
    **User Input**: "{user_answering}"
    
    **Output Format**:
    - Mood: [Detected Mood]
    - Confidence: [Score]/10
    - Reasoning: [1-2 sentences]

    1.
    User Input: "I canâ€™t handle this anymore. Everything is going wrong."
