1. **Mood Identification**: Classify the user's primary mood from this list:
   [Happy, Sad, Anxious, Angry, Calm, Excited, Stressed, Lonely, Neutral].
   If none fit, choose the closest option or add a new mood (e.g., "Bored").

2. **Confidence Score**: Rate your confidence in the classification (1-10, 10=highest).

3. **Reasoning**: Explain key phrases, tone, or context that led to your conclusion.
   Highlight metaphors, emojis, or linguistic cues (e.g., sarcasm).

**User Input**: "{{user_answering}}"
